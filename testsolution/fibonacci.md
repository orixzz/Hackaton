## Fiboh Nashi vault We found a Japanese weapons dealer who goes by the name of "Fiboh Nashi". After coming to an agreement, he placed the weapons in a locked container protected by a digital lock. He didn't give us the password though, but merely a number that hints at the password. He told us that the correct code would be to apply his "four-mal name". I have an idea as to what he meant. ## The Task The code we received is 4 consecutive numbers of the fibonacci sequence added together. The real password is probably those four numbers separately. You must find a way to calculate those numbers. ### Parameters * The digital lock only accepts a string as answer * The string can only contain numbers * The numbers must be placed without separators. So no line endings, spaces, symbols etc. ### Example Let's say that the code we received was the number `18`. The fibonacci sequence goes as follows: ```` int[] fibonacci = {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21}; ```` You can get `18` by adding together these consecutive numbers from the fibonacci sequence: ``` int[] consecutiveNumbers = { 2, 3, 5, 8}; int value = 2 + 3 + 5 + 8; // == 18 ``` So the passcode would be as follows: ```` String answer = "2358"; ```` ### Request | Key | Data type | |:------------------:|:--------------------------:| | value | BigInteger | example: ```json { "value": 18 } ``` ### Response | Key | Data type | |:------------------:|:--------------------------:| | value | String | example: ```json { "value": "2358" } ```
